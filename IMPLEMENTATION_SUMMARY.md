This pull request replaces the dynamic SVG image source in the `README.md` file's header with a static image source `assets/banner.png`. The original header utilized a dynamically generated SVG from `https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com`. The change specifically targets the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag within the `<h1>` element, preserving all other surrounding HTML structure. This modification aims to provide a stable, locally sourced image for the profile banner.
